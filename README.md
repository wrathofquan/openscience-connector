# Open Science & Reproducibility  

Fall 2018

Office Hours: tbd  


### Course Description

In a 2016 poll of 1,576 researchers by the [journal _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970), "more than 70% have failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments."  What has become known as the modern "replication crisis" began in the field of [Psychology](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716) as a series of replication studies and has spread to many fields including: Economics, Medicine, Political Science, Physics, Environmental Science, and others.

 In this course, Data Science students across domains will be introduced to concepts in scientific reproducibility and transparency through readings, case-studies, and hands-on lab activities. The course is intended as a survey of topics for students who have taken or are currently enrolled in Data 8/100. Students in the course will learn about the principles of doing open science, be able to create their own reproducible workflows, and gain an introduction to computational tools for Reproducible Data Analysis (Jupyterhub, Rstudio), Collaboration (Git/Github), Reporting (Markdown, Pandoc) and Data Archiving (Dataverse, Zenodo).

### Grading



### Late Policy


### Attendance


### Participation

### Collaboration and Academic Honesty

Do your own work. Collaborating on homework is cool. Copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the Center for the Student Conduct.

### Disability Accommodations

If you need accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, please speak to me after class or during office hours. Please make arrangements in a timely manner (through DSP) so that I can make the appropriate accommodations.
