## Course Description

[According to a 2016 poll of 1,576 researchers by the journal _Nature_, more than 70% have failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and "more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments."](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970). The "replication crisis" discussion started in Psychology and has extended to many fields including: chemistry, biology, physics and engineering, medicine, economics, and Earth and Environmental Science. In this course, students in the Data Sciences will be introduced to concepts in scientific reproducibility through readings, case-studies, and hands-on lab activities. We will explore topics including: data provenance, privacy and security, metadata standards, and use of computation tools (Jupyter Notebooks, Rstudio, Git).
